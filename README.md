# Falling-Sand

this repo includes SFML library files, i have read that this is not usually done, but i dont think anyone other then me will even see this so it should be fine :p

Falling Sand Engine / Game based on a couple youtube videos and inspired by noita.

this is my first ever working graphics repo.

Controlls:

mouse 1: place selected material
mouse 2: place selected material spawner
mousewheel changes cursorsize 
arrow keys for switching materials (1-9 for the first couple)
b - selects fire
f - Fills screen with selected material
c - clears selected material off the screen
r - resets all elements
x - closes program
d - prints debug info to console for material selected by mouse
esc - pauses sim
space - singlesteps sim when paused
minus - selected brush -1
equals - selected brush +1


thats all. thanks
